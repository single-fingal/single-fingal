- 👋 Hi, I’m @single-fingal.
- 👀 I’m interested in creating useful software and working together to do so.
- 🌱 I’m currently exercising my Python muscles. I've been at it sincerely for a few years, now. Currently focusing on relatively low-level (for userspace) applications and integrations, but my experience is wide, and interests are wider.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on almost anything written in Python, for now.
- 📫 How to reach me: xezontub at pm.me
