- 👋 Hi, I’m @single-fingal.
- 👀 I’m interested in creating software and working together to do so.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python. Focusing on GUI programming with Python and relatively low-level (for userspace) applications and integrations, for now.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on almost anything written in Python.
- 📫 How to reach me: xezontub at pm.me
