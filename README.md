- 👋 Hi, I’m @single-fingal.
- 👀 I’m interested in creating useful software and working together to do so. I've recently (2022) begun sharing some open source contributions, and I'm liking what I'm learning in the process.
- 🌱 I’m currently exercising my Python muscles. I've been at it sincerely for a few years, now, though I've been programming for a couple of decades. Currently focusing on relatively low-level (for userspace) applications and integrations, but my experience is wide, and my interests are wider.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on almost anything written in Python, for now.
- 📫 How to reach me: xezontub at pm.me
